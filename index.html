          In the fall of 2017 I went to the Earthship Community in Taos, New
          Mexico to learn how to build these off-grid sustainable living homes
          called "Earthships" at the Earthship Academy.

          I learned about how these homes are capable of creating a completely
          off-grid, self-sustaining system by utilizing the elements of nature
          and recycling technologies. One of my favorite examples would be how
          these homes use different types plants within a filtration system
          called "Bio-Cells" which are connected with the plumbing in the house.
          These plants filter the water that drains from sinks after usage and
          recycle the water into the tanks of the toilets. Once those toilets
          are used, the water is then processed into the outside of the house
          with another plant filtration system to clean the black water
          naturally.

          While attending the Earthship Academy, I met some new friends from
          Puerto Rico who came to Taos to learn about how to build Earthships so
          that they can bring these technologies to their home. This was
          approximately one month after Hurricane Maria. We shared a lot of the
          same sentiments about society and had complimentary values. I felt a
          calling inside of me to go and work with them to rebuild better homes
          in Puerto Rico and create a community. The Earthship organization also
          wanted to help, so they worked with my friends from Puerto Rico to
          acquire land, provide a crew, and material which were all donated. The
          plan was to build a structure consisting of 5 hut style concrete domes
          that were connected via the gutter system.

          We were able to find people who wanted to work us and had farmland we
          could build on. We worked as a community and started with a overgrown
          plot of land and donated or scavenged materials.

          We used old car tires to create the foundation. They were rammed with
          earth and anchored with rebar in a circular pattern.

          We used tons of plastics crushed together to creat an insulative
          barrier to keep the heat out and cool air in.

          It was a lot of work but we got pretty far before I had to leave the project. As you can see we used a lot of recyclable material such as: cans, tires, glass bottles. It was an amazing experience and I hope to continue with more projects in sustainable construction in the future.
